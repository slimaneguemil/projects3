# DevOps with Kubernetes
This is the code repository for [DevOps with Kubernetes](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/devops-kubernetes?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788396646), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Containerization is said to be the best way to implement DevOps. Google developed Kubernetes, which orchestrates containers efficiently and is considered the frontrunner in container orchestration. Kubernetes is an orchestrator that creates and manages your containers on clusters of servers. This book will guide you from simply deploying a container to administrate a Kubernetes cluster, and then you will learn how to do monitoring, logging, and continuous deployment in DevOps. The initial stages of the book will introduce the fundamental DevOps and the concept of containers. It will move on to how to containerize applications and deploy them into. The book will then introduce networks in Kubernetes. We then move on to advanced DevOps skills such as monitoring, logging, and continuous deployment in Kubernetes. It will proceed to introduce permission control for Kubernetes resources via attribute-based access control and role-based access control. The final stage of the book will cover deploying and managing your container clusters on the popular public cloud Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. At the end of the book, other orchestration frameworks, such as Docker Swarm mode, Amazon ECS, and Apache Mesos will be discussed.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
$ sudo yum -y -q install nginx
$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
Starting nginx:
```

This book will guide you through the methodology of software development and delivery
with Docker container and Kubernetes using macOS and public cloud (AWS and GCP). You
will need to install minikube, AWSCLI, and the Cloud SDK to run the code samples present
in this book.
