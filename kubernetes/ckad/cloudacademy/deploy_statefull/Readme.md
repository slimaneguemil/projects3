Description
Lab Overview

Stateful applications are applications with memory of the past. Kubernetes has achieved wide adoption for deploying stateless applications. Kubernetes also provides a rich set of features for running stateful applications. Adoption of Kubernetes for stateful applications is growing and so is the list of stateful workloads that are supported by Kubernetes. In this Lab you will deploy a stateful application in a Kubernetes cluster to understand how Kubernetes supports stateful applications.
Lab Objectives

Upon completion of this Lab you will be able to:

    Describe methods for deploying Kubernetes clusters in the cloud
    Explain how Kubernetes can deploy stateful applications
    Determine if it is a good idea to move a stateful application into Kubernetes
    Use Kubernetes to automatically provision persistent cloud storage volumes
    Expose Kubernetes applications via cloud load balancers
    Monitor and manage Kubernetes clusters using the Kubernetes Dashboard

Lab Prerequisites

You should be familiar with:

    Basic Kubernetes concepts such as pods, services, and deployments
    AWS EBS volumes
    Working on the command line in Linux
